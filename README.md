# CFD-Analysis-of-the-VKI-Turbine-Blade-Cascade-using-Ansys-CFX

# Problem Statement:
In this project, the study of a VKI turbine blade is done over a control volume to analyse the
flow pattern and performance parameters that can be used further to improve efficiency and
performance. The analysis will be done using the CFD tools. One of the main goals of this
project is to become acquainted with one of the numerous commercially available CFD
software, CFX.
The VKI turbine blade is a typical 1st stage gas turbine blade. The cylindrical design of the
blade has same 2D cross section from hub to tip. The objective of this project is to do model
set-up and simulate a linear cascade of VKI blade using Ansys CFX tool, which will be further
post processed to obtain typical turbine performance parameters.
## Following parameters will be obtained to assess the performance of the blade.
### 1) Isentropic Mach number distribution at the inlet and exit of the of the cascade.
### 2) Plot the isentropic Mach number distribution over the suction and pressure surface of
### the blade.
### 3) Total pressure loss across the blade.
### 4) Contours of the velocity, pressure, and temperature across the cascade.
